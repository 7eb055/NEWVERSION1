## API Integration

### Updated Endpoints Used:
1. **`GET /api/events/:eventId/attendee-listing`**
   - Replaces the old `/api/events/:eventId/attendees`
   - Provides comprehensive attendee data
   - Includes payment, registration, and attendance information

2. **`GET /api/events/:eventId/attendee-stats`**
   - Replaces the old `/api/events/:eventId/attendance/stats`
   - Provides detailed statistics including revenue and capacity
   - Better structured data for dashboard display

### Data Structure Mapping:
The component now handles the new data structure:

```javascript
// Old structure
{
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@email.com",
  status: "checked-in"
}

// New comprehensive structure
{
  attendee_name: "John Doe",
  attendee_email: "john@email.com", 
  attendee_phone: "+1-555-0123",
  attendance_status: "checked_in",
  payment_status: "completed",
  total_amount: 199.99,
  special_requirements: "Vegetarian meal",
  dietary_restrictions: "Vegetarian",
  ticket_type: "Early Bird",
  registration_date: "2024-02-01T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
