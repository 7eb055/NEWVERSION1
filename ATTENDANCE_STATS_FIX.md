# Attendance Stats Fix

## Issue Summary
The attendance statistics were not displaying properly because of a mismatch between the API response structure and how the data was being stored in the component state.

## Changes Made
1. Changed `response.data.statistics` to `response.data.stats` when updating the `attendanceStats` state
2. Added more detailed logging to troubleshoot any further issues
3. Added logging for the fallback stats loading as well

## Debugging
- The API response contains a `stats` field, but the code was looking for a `statistics` field
- Added detailed logging to monitor the data structure at each step
- Enhanced the fallback method logging to better understand what's happening when the primary endpoint fails

## Next Steps
1. Check the browser console for the added logs to verify the data structure
2. Verify that the statistics now display correctly
3. Consider adding more robust error handling and data validation for API responses
