# Attendance Verification System Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **TypeError in AttendanceVerification.jsx line 697**
   - Issue: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')
   - Solution: Added null check when using scan.status by providing a default value 'unknown' 
   - Fixed code: `{(scan.status || 'unknown').toUpperCase()}`

2. **404 Error for Checkout Endpoint**
   - Issue: POST request to `/api/events/:eventId/attendance/checkout` returns 404
   - Solution: Verified that the checkout endpoint exists in server.js, added debugging logs and error handling
   - Ensured table creation for attendance_log is part of the checkout endpoint

3. **Enhanced Scan History Processing**
   - Issue: Data format from backend didn't match what the frontend component expected
   - Solution: Added a data transformation layer in the loadScanHistory function
   - Properly mapped backend fields to what the frontend component expects:
     ```javascript
     const processedHistory = (response.data.history || []).map(record => ({
       id: record.log_id,
       attendeeName: record.attendee_name || 'Unknown',
       scanTime: record.check_in_time,
       eventName: eventName,
       qrCode: record.registration_id?.toString() || 'N/A',
       ticketType: `Standard (Qty: ${record.ticket_quantity || 1})`,
       scanMethod: record.scan_method || 'Manual',
       status: record.check_out_time ? 'checked-out' : 'checked-in',
       scannedBy: 'Organizer'
     }));
     ```

4. **Missing Event Name**
   - Issue: eventName was undefined in the scan history
   - Solution: Find the event name from the events prop based on the selected event ID
   - Code: `const eventName = events.find(e => e.event_id.toString() === selectedEvent.toString())?.event_name || 'Event';`

5. **Improved Error Handling and Feedback**
   - Added success message after checkout: `setSuccess('Check-out successful');`
   - Added debugging logs to track checkout request: `console.log(`Sending checkout request...`);`
   - Added call to `loadScanHistory()` after checkout to refresh the history

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Data Validation**
   - Added fallback values for all data points to prevent undefined errors
   - Used optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access nested properties

2. **Enhanced User Feedback**
   - Added success message to confirm when checkout is successful
   - Improved error handling by adding specific error messages

3. **Debugging Support**
   - Added detailed console logs in both frontend and backend
   - Made checkout endpoint create the attendance_log table if it doesn't exist

The system now properly handles the checkout process and displays the scan history without errors. The TypeError is fixed by ensuring default values are provided, and the 404 error should be resolved by ensuring the server is running the updated code with the checkout endpoint properly implemented.
