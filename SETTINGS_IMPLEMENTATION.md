\i add-settings-columns.sql
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The settings routes are automatically mounted at `/api/settings` when the server starts.

### 3. Frontend Integration
The Settings page is fully integrated with the backend and ready to use.

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Modify any settings as needed
3. Changes are saved automatically for toggles and dropdowns

- Error handling is implemented throughout
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Easy to extend with additional settings

## Security Considerations

### Password Management
- Current password verification required
- Minimum password length enforced
- Password change timestamps tracked

### Account Deletion
- Soft delete preserves data integrity
- Personal information is anonymized
- Confirmation text prevents accidental deletion

### Data Export
- Only user's own data is accessible
- Secure authentication required
- Complete data transparency

## Testing

- [ ] Change privacy visibility
- [ ] Enable/disable 2FA
- [ ] Change password with valid credentials
- [ ] Change password with invalid credentials
- [ ] Export user data
- [ ] Delete account with correct confirmation
- [ ] Delete account with incorrect confirmation

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid data rejected appropriately
- [ ] Authentication errors handled properly

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Full 2FA Implementation**: SMS/Email verification codes

4. **Data export empty**: Check if user has associated data

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend server is running
3. Check database connection
4. Validate API endpoints are accessible

## API Response Examples

### Successful Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Settings updated successfully",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response
