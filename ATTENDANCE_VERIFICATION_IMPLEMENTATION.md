# Attendance Verification System Implementation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of the attendance verification system for the event management platform. The system allows event organizers to track attendees, manage check-ins and check-outs, and view attendance history.

## Endpoints Implemented

### 1. GET /api/events/:eventId/attendee-listing
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a comprehensive list of all attendees registered for an event
- **Authentication**: Requires organizer authentication
- **Response**: Returns detailed information about all attendees, including their check-in status

### 2. GET /api/events/:eventId/attendee-stats
- **Purpose**: Provides statistical data about attendance for the event
- **Authentication**: Requires organizer authentication
- **Response**: Returns metrics like total registered, total checked-in, currently present, and attendance percentage

### 3. POST /api/events/:eventId/attendance/checkin
- **Purpose**: Records an attendee's check-in to the event
- **Authentication**: Requires organizer authentication
- **Request Body**: Requires either `registration_id` or `qr_code`
- **Response**: Confirms successful check-in with attendee details

### 4. GET /api/events/:eventId/attendance/history
- **Purpose**: Retrieves the complete attendance history for an event
- **Authentication**: Requires organizer authentication
- **Response**: Returns all check-in and check-out records with attendee details

### 5. POST /api/events/:eventId/attendance/checkout
- **Purpose**: Records an attendee's check-out from the event
- **Authentication**: Requires organizer authentication
- **Request Body**: Requires either `registration_id` or `log_id`
- **Response**: Confirms successful check-out with attendee details
- **Special Features**: Supports checking out by either registration_id or log_id, with detailed logging
- **Debug Implementation**: Enhanced with extensive logging to help troubleshoot checkout issues

### 6. POST /api/events/:eventId/attendance/manual
- **Purpose**: Two functions in one endpoint:
  1. Check in an existing registered attendee (when `registration_id` is provided)
  2. Register and check in a new attendee (when `full_name` and `email` are provided)
- **Authentication**: Requires organizer authentication
- **Request Body Options**:
  - For existing attendees: `registration_id`
  - For new attendees: `full_name`, `email`, `phone` (optional), `ticket_quantity` (optional)
- **Response**: Creates user/attendee if needed, registers for event if needed, and checks them in
- **Special Features**: Handles both existing attendee check-in and new walk-in registration in a single endpoint

## Database Structure
The system uses the `attendance_log` table with the following structure:
- `log_id`: Primary key
- `registration_id`: References the event registration
- `event_id`: References the event
- `check_in_time`: Timestamp of check-in
- `check_out_time`: Timestamp of check-out (nullable)
- `created_at`: Record creation timestamp

## Frontend Integration
The attendance verification functionality is used in the AttendanceVerification.jsx component, which provides organizers with a user interface to:
- View the list of registered attendees
- Check in attendees (manually or via QR code)
- Check out attendees
- View attendance history and statistics

## Implementation Notes
- All attendance endpoints verify that the user is an organizer and that the event belongs to that organizer
- The system tracks both check-in and check-out times to enable accurate attendance tracking
- QR code support allows for faster check-in process
- The history endpoint provides comprehensive data for attendance reporting
- Manual registration allows for on-the-spot attendance for walk-in attendees
- Transaction management ensures data integrity during manual registration process

## Next Steps
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
- Add advanced filtering options for attendance reports
- Integrate with notification system to alert attendees about their check-in/check-out status
